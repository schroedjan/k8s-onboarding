# CrossPlane

Crossplane is an open-source Kubernetes add-on that enables you to manage cloud resources using Kubernetes-style APIs. It allows you to provision and manage infrastructure resources such as databases, storage, and networking directly from your Kubernetes cluster.

## Example

See an example to manage AWS resources with crossplane in [K8s Crossplance](./k8s-crossplane/README.md).
