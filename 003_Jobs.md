# K8s Jobs

Kubernets Jobs are used to run a batch job to completion. A job creates one or more pods and ensures that a specified number of them successfully terminate. As pods successfully complete, the job tracks the successful completions. When the desired number of completions is reached, the job is complete.

See [k8s-job](./k8s-job/README.md) for example files.
