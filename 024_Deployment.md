# Kubernetes Deployments

Kubernetes Deployments are a higher-level abstraction for managing the deployment of applications on Kubernetes. They provide a way to define the desired state of an application, including the number of replicas, the container image to use, and other configuration options. The Deployment controller then ensures that the actual state of the application matches the desired state.

See [k8s-deployment](./k8s-deployment/README.md) for example files.
